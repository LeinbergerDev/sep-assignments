Doubling the array size everytime that there is a collision could quickly start
having issues.  First there is the density of the array issue.  Take our movie has 
as an example.  This has starts out with 6 items.  There is a collision between 
'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Lord of the Rings: 
The Return of the King'.  Using our hashing function both of these keys will try 
to store their value in index 5.  When we resize the array to 12 the collision
still occures.  We have to resize the array a second time to get rid of this collision.
So after dealing with this collision we have an array size of 24 for at the most 
6 items.  That is 4 times as many empty slots.
