Line data structure:
the line data structures models a group of people standing in a line.
#1) Developers can access the members of the line by access the line.members property.
    A developer can find the first person in the line by using the front method.  The 
    middle person is returned by using the middle method and the last person is returned
    by using the line.back method.
    Developers can add a person to the line by using the line.join("name") method.  And 
    he or she can remove a person from the line by using the line.leave("name") method.
    
#2) A developer can also check if a person is in the line by using the line.search("name")
    method.  This will return person if he or she is in the line and nil if he or she is not.

#3) The line data stucture is an object that stores an array and has methods for 
    manipulating the data within the array.  Another real world example of where a 
    data stucture like this could be used would be keeping track of the number of
    cars for sale on a car lot.  Or it could also be used to keep track of the
    number of people in a store.

Screen Data Structure:
The screen data structure object stores the state of a matrix that represents the
pixels on a screen.
#1) Developers can access the matrix by using the screen.at(x,y) method (where the x
    and y are coordinates on the screen).  This will return a pixel object with properties
    of red, green, blue, x and y.  The developer can insert pixel data into the screen object
    by using the screen.insert(pixel, x, y) method.
#2) Developers can retreive a value from the screen matrix by using the screen.at(x,y) method.
#3) The screen object stores a matrix of color values.  This type of structure could
    also be used for creating or manipulating and image.
